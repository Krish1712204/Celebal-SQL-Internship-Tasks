### 🔹 Week 6 - Pivot, Error Handling, Transactions & LeetCode Problems

This week introduces **data reshaping**, **robust error handling**, and **transaction management** in SQL Server. It also includes **LeetCode-style SQL problems** that help apply concepts in real-world scenarios.

#### 📚 Key Topics:

- `PIVOT` – Transform rows into columns  
- `UNPIVOT` – Transform columns back into rows  
- Error Handling using `TRY...CATCH` blocks  
  - Error Handling – Part 1: Handling syntax/logical errors  
  - Error Handling – Part 2: Custom error messages, nested try-catch  
- Transactions & ACID Properties  
- `MERGE` Statement – Conditional `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`  
- **Window Functions**:  
  - `ROW_NUMBER()`  
  - `RANK()`  
  - `DENSE_RANK()`  
  - `NTILE()`  
- LeetCode SQL Problems (Performance-focused)

📁 **Folder:** `Week-6-Pivot-ErrorHandling/`  
📄 **Assignment:** `Advanced SQL Operations + LeetCode Practice`

📝 **Summary:**  
This week's assignments focus on writing modular, error-resilient SQL scripts using PIVOT/UNPIVOT for data transformation, TRY...CATCH blocks for graceful error handling, and transactions to preserve data consistency. The MERGE operation is explored for conditional data updates. The week ends with solving SQL interview-level problems inspired by LeetCode to improve query optimization and problem-solving skills.
